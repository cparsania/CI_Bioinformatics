Hey everyone! 👋 If you’re new to R and RStudio, follow these simple steps to get started with data analysis and coding in R!

**Step 1: Download & Install R**

🔹 R is the core programming language we’ll be using. You need to install it first before using RStudio.
1. Go to CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) (https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Click on “Download R for (Windows/Mac/Linux)”
 
3. Choose the latest version and install it like any other software.
💡 Tip: If you’re on Windows, select “base” to install R.



**Step 2: Download & Install RStudio**

🔹 RStudio is a powerful IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes working with R much easier and more user-friendly.

1. Go to RStudio Download Page
2. Click “Download RStudio Desktop (Free)”

**Step 3: Run Your First R Code**

Once RStudio is open, try running this simple code in the Console (bottom-left panel):

// print("Hello, R world! 🚀")
 
Hit Enter, and you should see "Hello, R world! 🚀" printed on the screen.

**Step 4: Explore RStudio**

🔹 Script Editor (Top-Left) → Write & save your R scripts (.R files).

🔹 Console (Bottom-Left) → Run R commands interactively.

🔹 Environment (Top-Right) → View variables & datasets.

🔹 Files/Plots/Packages (Bottom-Right) → Manage files, install packages, and visualize plots.


**Step 5: Install Your First Package**

Packages expand R’s capabilities. Try installing the popular tidyverse package for data science:
install.packages("tidyverse")

// library(tidyverse)

Now you’re all set to start your R journey! 🚀🎉
